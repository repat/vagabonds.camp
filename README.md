## About Us

> The Vagabonds is a growing international collective of burners who have organised theme camps at AfrikaBurn since 2019 and Borderland since 2022. In the default world, we are a diverse group of travelers, entrepreneurs, nomads, free spirits, creatives, and dreamers.
> 
> Initially inspired by the aesthetics of Swedish artist Simon Stålenhag and his Vagabond robots,this once Nordic-centric community has since grown to over 200 members who come to meet from all corners of the world to connect, co-create and co-live.
> 
> We gather in the dust and dirt to celebrate life beyond the edges of civilization; to recharge our batteries, sweat out our inner demons and dance like the universe is watching.
